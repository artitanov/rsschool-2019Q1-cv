# About Me
Artyom, 23 years old, live Minsk.
I started my education in front-end at December 2018. I can't defenitely remember what idea came into my mind, but since that time i have started my way of lerning.
All of my free time I spend to learn more and more.
It is very interesting for me to take some task and try to solve it. If i don't have enough  knowledge to do some task, i try to find answer in Google while I won't solve the task.
It cool, step by step, finding more information and solving some task, I feel how my knowledges are improving. 
I have many friends who are working a programmists. But i have never asked for them to help me. Only some questions, to understand how true is my way of learning. 
It is interesting for me to find answer myself, than to receive a ready code.
I want to work for a big company. It's important to me to be in a group of people who are interested the same idea like i'm. 
I want to participate in a big projects and improve my skills. I'm ready to spend all my time and all power for work, because it very interesting to me. 
Before november, time when i started my way in that, there wasn't any subject, any job that involved me as hard as IT.
It's amazing, first in my life i feel that i found myself.
